<p>Remember kids - all the materials and tools provided in here  are strictly for educational purposes, we do not endorse any illegal activities related to spam/fraud,we are here to learn how to interact with the api's on an example on Discord's one!</p>

<p>Furthermore - i genially think that we will limit amount of active licences to 50 at all times because i would rather have less peeps , but be sure that Discord( Hi there❤️ Pls let us be , we really small and that is exactly how i want it to stay!) pays as little of attention to us, as possible and does not flags the tool, making everybody's life easier.</p>

<p><br />- What is DMDPie?<br />- Its a Discord mass messaging software which goal is to fix the problems <br />that is caused by use of dmdgo/other softwares i.e. captchas, low avg, high price and so on<br /><br />- How can i get an acess? How much does it costs?<br />- A weekly acess for the Linux wersion is 40$, you can purchase a key at https://mr-token.mysellix.io/ <br /><br />- What do i need launch software?<br />- You will need an virtual machine/rdp with the installed Linux(Ubuntu is good) , internet connection, licence key with acess.<br /><br /><br />- Why dont you sell Long-term subscriptions?<br />- Imagine Discord patches software? We will takme a few days/weeks,to fix the thingy, and imagine all the money you will be loosing, therefor you will be preasurring us to "fix fast" and we dont wont that.<br />We better be fixing the software while earning 0's but will assure that noone of you are loosing money because of us.<br /><br />Therefore especially for first few months, we will run on the daily/weekly/monthly subscription model, aint working for free, deal with it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />=====Technical questions=====<br /><br /><br />- What proxy format should i use?<br />- login:pass@ip:port format, rotating proxies wont work well, and the proxies with ip binding wont work at all.<br /><br />- What tokens format are supported?<br />- Multiformatting is supported, just select your desired input format in the menu on the bottom side of the software. Note: you cant mix token formats in one file.<br /><br />- Can your software work with fresh tokens?<br />- It can work with fresh tokens! depending on an email provider and token state( email verified, phone verified) results may wary, but at the time of writing of that text<br />fresh phone verified gmail tokens with age of 2 days can do 10 dm's with no captcha and then up to 300 after, while solving captchas.<br />Proof: https://t.me/mrtoken_upd/180<br /><br />- What captcha services are supported?<br />- At the moment of writing (v 1.0.2) only supported captcha services is: <br />CapMonster(cheaper option, worse quality) <br />2Captcha( lilbit more pricey, yet lets you obtain amazing results)<br /><br />-Can i use more then 10 tokens simultaniously on a same server?<br />- Tehchnicly yes, you can, you just have to make sure no more then 10 tokens with the same registration date are working on the server,<br />i.e. if you have 10 tokens of 01.01.2020 and 10 tokens of 03.01.2020 you should be allright, but if there is 11th, youll triger server's internal antibot and flag entire pack that is related to that date.<br />Proof: https://t.me/mrtoken_upd/183<br /><br />- What is internal Antibot?<br />-It Discord's internal server's antibot, which is present on every server, it is hidden, and when triggered will put the desired server in the "antibot" mode,<br />which will result in captchas on join and flagged tokens.<br /><br />Our software IS NOT SOLVING THOSE CAPTCHAS ON PURPUSE, because if you do so, you will flag your tokens and face cpatchas on dm. <br /><br />If you ever facing captchas on join with known good tokens( you can test this by joining another server and if there is no captcha - then server you are trying to join is ratelimited)<br />you have to spot your joining process and wait at least 30 minutes before antibot mode is off.<br /><br />If you are facing captcha on the other servers - consider changing your token supplier, good quality tokens NEVER face cap on join, except the situations when antibot is in play.<br /><br />Remember, you arent alone, and some other user migh be trying to do the same server as you are (happens to popular servers) , and some servers will be just constantly ratelimited.<br /><br />Do not try do "cheat" you way in by waiting 15 mins, youll just retrigger antibot and will have to wait longer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />=====WHAT ARE THE BEST DM SETTINGS?=====<br /><br />I knew that you will ask that, and look, there is no defenitive answer for that, but ill try tive you my intake on what works and the reasoning behind it.<br /><br />Simplified settings are:<br /><br />Threads : Amount of tokens you desire to use, duh.<br /><br />Sleep on start: Either 1 or any custom number, it will allow you to start every thread with a desired delay, which will theoretily will help with suspicion avoidance, i.e. less tokens starting all thogether the same time.<br />You can also use the formula of Sleep on start =650/threads to acheive really interesting results.<br /><br />Sleep between dm's: When determining your sleep between dm's you should always rememebr that 1 token can send max 10 dm/10 min(failed included), after that it will have to sleep for some time,<br />therefore, if you are trying to send messages with 1 second delay, they will be send out in a matter of 10 seconds, but then will have to sleep for 10 minutes.<br />That can be avoided by setting your delay between dms on 75 , assuring that your token wont send more then 10 messages in 10 minutes span, so the best settings is either 1 or 75.<br /><br />Sleep on ratelimit:<br />Would depend on how fast you are sending the messages! :)<br />Classic setting is 600, but you can try experementing with it, if you use higher delays between dm's since normally, you should never face ratelimite by using those.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />=====Contacts=====<br /><br />Look , i dont mind yall spamming my dm's , but in the same time, guys you are indeed spamming my dms!<br />There is our chat of users , where you can share your experiences and talk to fellow collegues, to figure out a thing or two :)<br />Dont be shy, join us there!<br />https://t.me/MrTokResTok<br /><br />https://t.me/tosviolators<br /></p>
